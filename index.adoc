= Explain FP like Richard Feynman

== Hello

TODO: introduce myself

== Richard Feynman

[width="100",cols="1,2"]
|====================
a| image::img/bongos.jpg[Feynman on bongos] a| [%step]
* worked at Los Alamos on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project[the Manhattan Project]
* discovered https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram[Feynman diagrams]
* investigated https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster[the Challanger disaster]
* a curious and interesting guy
|====================

[NOTE.speaker]
--
The Manhattan project - creation of a nuclear bomb

Feynman diagrams - shows interaction between subatomic particles

_Sure, you're jocking, mr. Feynman!_ - recommend

Story how he got burned out etc

=== Keep it fun

TODO: feynman dancing and drawing ladies

TODO: image - show that programming is fun

TODO: don't - FP is principled and well defined

Mention about https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5oIIPO62g[John Cleese video about creativity]

Mention about - https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf[Mathematician's lament] - FP does not have to be practical, it has to be fun and satisfying

== Reviewing student's books

TODO: energy images

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Defining sth with energy is a tautology.

=== Order of explanation

[%step]
* don't explain things you try to explain using (even indirectly) things you want to explain
* abstraction is derived from specifics - not the other way round


== Question about magnets

TODO: images

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Interviewer asked about how magnets work.

Feynman described, how the answer depends on the framework of knowledge of asking side (normal person - magnetic force repels or attracts, physics student - electrons have a charge which can attract or repel depending on how they spin, more advanced explanation cannot refer to "things that the interviewer is familiar with".

=== Adjust the message to audience

[%step]
* not everyone has a CS background
* not everyone has any mathematical background
* if we want to teach someone a formal definition, we need to make sure they know the whole foundation they need before - and that takes time to adjust
